.NET Chia Wallet Library

## Introduction

Many thanks to [Rigidity](https://github.com/Rigidity) who's code this is a direct port of and and helped immensely along the way.

This is a direct port of the [chia node wallet typescript library](https://github.com/Chia-Network/node-chia-wallet-lib). Coding style and naming have been converted to C# conventions but otherwise it is very similar in API.
